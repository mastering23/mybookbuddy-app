 ### Fixing an issues in Details Component 
The first issue I encountered was rendering the "Available" keyword from the API value, which was a boolean. I resolved this by using the .toString() method to convert the boolean value to a string. This also led me to figure out how to display the pictures using the URL tag for the `<img src="">`
